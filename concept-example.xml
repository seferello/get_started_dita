  <title>Proposal Generation</title>
  <shortdesc>This concept discusses tried and true methods for creating a comprehensive bid or proposal response to a government contract RFP or RFI</shortdesc>
  <conbody>
    <p>In order to submit a compliant RFP response, you must first understand the RFP and break down it's elements. Please see the Creating a 
    Proposal Template page for information on how to do so. Every RFP includes rules on what information a vendor must include, how to submit that information, and how the information will be evaluated. 
    </p>
    <p>The second basic element of proposal generation is organization and version 
      control. In most instances, a proposal is made up of a skeleton that Subject 
      Matter Experts and the writer add content to until the proposal is fully 
      compliant. In rder to keep this process efficient and effective, the writer 
      must develop processes for establishing who can access the skeleton, what 
      they can contribute, and when a final version has been reached.</p>
